# Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)

## Description

The **Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)** can handle large integer arithmetic using doubly linked lists, surpassing the limitations of standard data types like `int` or `long`. This calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers, including negative values.

## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of large integers.
- Supports both positive and negative numbers.
- Utilizes **doubly linked lists** for precise handling of large integers.

## How to Compile and Run

### 1. **Compilation**

To compile the program, open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source files. Use the following command:

```bash
gcc Main.c Addition.c Subtraction.c Multiplication.c Division.c linked_list_operations.c -o APC

### 2. **Running the Program**
Run the compiled program using:
./a.out

### 3. **Input Format**
The program can be run interactively or using command-line arguments in the format:
```bash
USAGE: <operand1> <operator> <operand2>

## Example
```bash
./a.out 10 + 5
